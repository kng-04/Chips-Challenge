# üß© Larry Croft‚Äôs Adventures

_A SWEN225 Group Project ‚Äî Victoria University of Wellington (2024)_

## üìò Overview

**Larry Croft‚Äôs Adventures** is a creative reimagining of the classic *Chip‚Äôs Challenge* (1989), implemented entirely in Java. The game challenges players to solve tile-based mazes, collect keys and treasures, and escape each level ‚Äî all while evading hazards and enemies.  

This project was developed as part of the SWEN225 Software Design course, and brings together concepts of object-oriented design, modular architecture, event-driven programming, and quality assurance practices.

## üß± Architecture

The project is split into six distinct modules, each mapped to a Java package:

| Module       | Responsibility |
|--------------|----------------|
| `domain`     | Game logic and rules (tiles, objects, movement, collision, etc.) |
| `app`        | GUI management, keystroke handling, level switching, countdown timer |
| `renderer`   | Visual rendering of the game board, animations, sounds |
| `persistency`| JSON-based save/load and level storage |
| `recorder`   | Record and replay entire gameplay sessions |
| `fuzz`       | Automated input testing to detect edge cases and bugs |
